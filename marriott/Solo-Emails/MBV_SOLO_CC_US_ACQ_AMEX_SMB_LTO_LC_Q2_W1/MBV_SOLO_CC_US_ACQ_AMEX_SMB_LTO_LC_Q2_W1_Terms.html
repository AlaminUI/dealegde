We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible for additional Points. A purchase with a merchant will not receive additional Points if the merchantâ€™s code is not included in a reward category. You may not receive additional Points if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify your purchase as eligible for a reward category. For example, you may not receive additional Points when: a merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or a merchant uses a third-party to process or submit your transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or you choose to make a purchase using a third-party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet. For questions about additional Points on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card.
