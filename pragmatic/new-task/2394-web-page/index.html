<h2>What’s the big deal about Texas energy deregulation? 
Here’s what you need to know
 </h2>
 <h4>What is energy deregulation?
</h4>
<p>In layman’s terms, “energy deregulation” lets companies compete for your business and allowing you to choose your electricity provider. Retail Electricity Partners (REPs) like Pulse Power do not actually generate electricity but purchase it from an Independent System Operator (ISO) to sell to customers.  </p>



<h4>When did it happen?</h4>
<p>In 1999, the state legislature restructured the Texas electric market and assigned the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to oversee a competitive retail market. Customers were able to choose their provider starting on January 1, 2002. 
</p>
<p>While the grid operator is regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas: (PUCT) and the Texas Legislature, nonprofit ERCOT is tasked with ensuring reliable electric service for 90% of the state, managing the flow of electric power to more than 26 million Texas customers.

<h4>Deregulation puts you in control</h4>
<p>
    If you do live in one of the state’s deregulated areas (two of the largest metros in Texas are included, Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth), you have more control over your electricity bills. You can compare plans across different providers and select a rate and plan that fits the needs of your home. And if you’re not getting top-notch customer service from your current provider, you have the opportunity to switch.
    </p>

    <h4>More competition leads to cutting-edge innovation</h4>
    <p>
        Hundreds of providers are looking for ways to stand out from the crowd and gain your attention. Some providers, including Pulse Power, are supporting energy generated by renewable sources, like solar and wind power. We do this by offering plans backed by <a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/renewable-energy-certificates-recs">Renewable Energy Certificates</a> so even though you can’t choose where your electricity is sourced from, you can still support generation from renewable resources.

        <h4>Summing it up</h4>
        <p>
            Thanks to energy deregulation, you’ve got your pick of providers and plans, putting you in the driver’s seat to choose one that best meets your needs. And because of the competition for your business, providers will strive to give you better customer service, attractive pricing and innovative plans that make a positive impact. That’s something to be proud of, Texas!
