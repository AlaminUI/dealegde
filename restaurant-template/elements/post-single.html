          <h4 class='post-single-subtitle'>From ocean to plate: the story of seafood</h4>
          <p>When you chow down on a tuna melt or shrimp scampi, do you ever wonder how it got to your plate? Every seafood journey is different but has at least one thing in common: it goes through a lot to get there. Our journey begins on a cold and frosty morning in Port Lincoln, South Australia. Our goal is Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna.</p>
          <p>Not far from the shore, many SBT (Southern Bluefin Tuna) lease sites have been set up in what we call the ‘Boston Bay and Lincoln Offshore Aquaculture Zone’. There are approximately 12 companies maintaining ranch sites in over 100 platoons. The prized Bluefin Tuna are then fed a diet baitfish over a period of 4 – 5 months while it doubles in size.</p>
          <h4>The next step is visiting the local market to place an auction on the chosen products that our restaurant needs.</h4>
          <p>In the case of Southern Bluefin Tuna, we order these especially and within 48 hours we receive our order from Port Lincoln to Sydney to Seabay Restaurant. This kind of fish is exceptionally big and consists of:</p>

            <li class='list-item'>Akami (red meat);</li>
            <li class='list-item'>Chutoro (belly fat);</li>
            <li class='list-item'>Ootoro (tuna fat);</li>
            <li class='list-item'>Kamatoro (tuna collar).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is in kitchen where our expert Chefs fillet the Tuna for use in many dishes. You’ll find many restaurants will simply purchase Tuna, which has been pre-filleted at the markets. Although we have this option, Seabay have always been an advocate for maximum use, minimal waste and education. Our head chefs are experts in filleting the whole Tuna.</p>

It is in this kitchen that our dedicated Chefs design an intricate dish full of passion and flavour and rich in a journey which we feel, is worth telling.</figcaption>
